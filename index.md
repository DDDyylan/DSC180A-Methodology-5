**What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?** \
The most interesting part of the domain is the application of text-diffusion models. We learned how diffusion models can be concatenated with pretrained large language models for broader usage in natural language processing.

**Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.** \
A potential investigation in quarter 2 will be the various implementation of diffusion models. Although they are similar, or even identical in theory, the implementations differed a lot. The selection of neural networks may vary, and there is a dimension of differential equation to approach diffusion process, equivalent to the normal understanding ultimately.

**What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?** \
A potential change may be the source of models and references. In quarter 1, we focused on only one type of text-diffusion model, which integrating VAE with diffusion process. In quarter II, we will cover more types of combinations.

**What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?** \
In addition to normal deep learning work, I am interested in some model visualization that can display the networks in a clear way.
